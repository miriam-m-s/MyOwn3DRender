# OpenGL Render Engine

This project is a **custom rendering engine developed in C++ using OpenGL**.

## Description

The goal of this project is to build a rendering engine from scratch to better understand real-time graphics programming. It focuses on low-level rendering concepts and engine architecture, including:
- OpenGL rendering pipeline
- Shader management
- Mesh and buffer handling
- Camera and transformations
- Real-time rendering techniques

This project is primarily intended for learning, experimentation, and technical growth in graphics programming.

## Technologies
